# NonlinearStateEstimation


##### Project goals
The goal of this project was to do the task of state estimation of nonlinear dynamic objects using MCMC algorithms and compare obtained results with Unscented Kalman Filter and Particle Filter.

##### Technologies used
Python 3.11 - a high-level programming language with an extensive library package. Thanks to its
transparent syntax it allows you to create advanced, but most of all readable source codes.


##### Implementation

The project implementation was based on the following steps:
1.
